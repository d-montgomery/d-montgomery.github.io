## Overview of Research
My research focuses on using computational mathematics to gain insight into reactive flows, with applications including combustion of sustainable aviation fuels, CO2 desublimation, and blood clotting. This includes developing and maintaining open-source software written in C++ and Python.

## Hemostasis in a Microfluidic Device
Using the clotFoam software, we are able to simulate platelet-mediated coagulation in a variety of geometries.  This is an example of hemostasis in an extravascular injury that is modeled in an in-vitro microfluidic device. Blood enters the right channel while a buffer fluid enters the left channel at a lower flow rate.  The difference in flow rates cause blood to flow through the horizontal channel which is coated with tissue factor and collagen proteins to initiate platelet adhesion and coagulation respectively.

## Thrombosis
In this example, we use the clotFoam software to simulate thrombosis from an intravascular injury.
