I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Computational Science at the National Laboratory of the Rockies. I develop high-performance computational tools for reactive flow, combustion, and energy applications.

Research areas include:

- Combustion performance of synthetic aviation turbine fuels (SATF)
- Multicomponent fuel property prediction
- Carbon capture systems  
- Multiphysics CFD  
- Blood clotting dynamics

### Featured Projects

**[FuelLib](https://github.com/NatLabRockies/FuelLib)**  
Open-source library for predicting thermophysical properties of complex aviation fuels using group contribution methods.

**[clotFoam](https://github.com/d-montgomery/clotFoam)**  
CFD solver for modeling blood clot formation.

**[Pele](https://amrex-combustion.github.io)**  
Contributor to the AMReX-based Pele combustion suite for large-scale reacting flow simulations.
